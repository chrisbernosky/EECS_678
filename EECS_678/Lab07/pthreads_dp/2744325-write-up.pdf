1.) The philosiphers pick up alternating chopsticks depending on their location around the table. One philosipher will pick up the chopstick to his left and the other philosipher will pick up the chopstick to his right. This ensures that the philosiphers are never competing for the same chopstick no matter who wins the race.

2.) No, because one philosipher may have the left and right chopstick and the man next to him may only have his left chopstick. Depending on the time that takes place the philosipher with one chopstick could set his down and pick it back up before the man on the right releases his. This would not allow the philosipher to pickup both chopsticks causing starvation.

3.) This works by only allowing the philosipher to come out of sleep when both chopsticks are available and the waiter is locked. This ensures that there will never be two philosiphers fighting over the same chopstick.

4.) No, this method is first come first serve, so even if both chopsticks are available the philosipher still has to aquire the waitress. If he can not aquire the waitress before the philosipher next to him then he will go back to sleep and not eat, therefore allowing for starvation.

5.) As stated above, since it is a first come first serve basis depending on where the waiter is then Phil could be without chopsticks if the philosipher next to him puts in the same request and has it granted before he does.
